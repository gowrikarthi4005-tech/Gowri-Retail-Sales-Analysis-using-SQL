# Gowri-Retail-Sales-Analysis-using-SQL
This project analyzes retail sales data using SQL to uncover trends in product performance, customer behavior, and regional sales. SQL queries with JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and window functions were used to aggregate, filter, and visualize data effectively, identifying top-selling products, seasonal trends, and high-value customers.
